From starting my first company at the age of 14, to building a new department at Excalibur Press, I've learned that the tech world isn't just about codes and algorithms; it's about people, the stories behind them, and their connections with each other. My combination of skills and interest in both business strategy and technology - both refined at university as well as in the real world - has given me a unique perspective, one that values both the blueprint and the hands that build from it.

While I have a knack for strategy and a deep respect for craft, I have always believed in a more hands-on approach. You might catch a subtle smirk when bureaucracy gets too thick or when convention needs a little nudge. It's all in good fun, of course.

Championing the underdogs and leveraging technology to level the playing field and build a better society is what drives me. My heart is rooted in public service, and digital transformation through creative enterprise is how I feel I can best achieve it. I'm also a keen advocate for the autistic community, of which I am a part.

Looking to bridge the gap between strategy and execution, build something cool, or perhaps share a knowing glance about the quirks of our industry? Let's connect.
